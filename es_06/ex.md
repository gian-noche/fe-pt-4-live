let students = [
    { name: 'Alice', age: 20, grades: [85, 92, 88] },
    { name: 'Bob', age: 22, grades: [70, 80, 75] },
    { name: 'Charlie', age: 23, grades: [95, 90, 93] },
    { name: 'David', age: 21, grades: [60, 65, 70] },
    { name: 'Eve', age: 20, grades: [78, 82, 85] }
];
1. Use a for loop to print each student's name and age.
2. Use forEach to print each student's name and average grade.

5. Use pop to remove the last student from the array.
6. Use unshift to add a new student to the beginning of the array.
7. Use shift to remove the first student from the array.
8. Use join to create a string of student names separated by commas.
9. Define a function expression to check if a student's average grade is greater than 80.
10. Use filter with the function expression to create an array of students with high average grades.
11. Define a callback function to print student details.
12. Use forEach with the callback function to print details of all students.
13. Use an arrow function inside forEach to print if each student is "Pass" or "Fail" based on their average grade.
